# Husky Project used for Demonstration

Since the original husky is not yet supported on ROS melodic - here a collection of the source code.
Additionally the following packages need to be installed (available as binaries).
Install them with
'''sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-<pkg>'''
- robot-localization
- twist-mux
